I need to find X (Twitter) accounts that provide high-signal, real-time information relevant to resolving this prediction market:

Market: "{market_question}"

Please search for and identify 5-10 specific X accounts.
Focus on:
1. Domain experts (e.g., specific sports analysts, political pollsters, economic data aggregators).
2. Accounts that tweet fast, factual updates.
3. Accounts that track specific metrics relevant to the market (e.g., Google Trends trackers, flight trackers, court reporters).

For example:
- If the market is "Will Lando Norris win?", look for F1 data analysis accounts.
- If the market is "Who will be #1 searched person?", look for Google Trends tracking accounts.

Return ONLY a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
    "accounts": [
        {{
            "handle": "@handle",
            "url": "https://x.com/handle",
            "name": "Account Name",
            "reason": "Why this account is relevant"
        }}
    ]
}}
